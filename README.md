When we want to extract some information from some books, it will be a waste of time to type the content of the book into documents; When others ask us to convert paper documents into electronic files, typing will also waste us a long time. So, we decided to design a program to take pictures and extract texts to help us save time. So, our project is to use the code to call our mobile phone camera to take a picture, and print the text on the image, so that we can copy and paste it. During the project, our group encountered a problem: when we called the camera, the window appeared for a moment, and then disappeared immediately. We were confused, then we found that we just had to write an unending loop to maintain our window. We have done many tests, and as long as the photos are clear enough and not handwriting, the accuracy rate can reach 95%.
